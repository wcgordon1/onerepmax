# Yoooo here's the code for One Rep Max Calculator

### What is this??

- I started this project using bolt.new (kept that at the bottom) and 'cleaned it up' in Cursor. I'm using Astro & React. I'm using TailwindCSS. I'm using TypeScript. I'm using i18next for translations. 

- This is pretty much all AI code guided by me because why not? It's just a rad domain name and I used to be super into lifting. 315 bench at 18. Shoutout Bodybuilding.com forums circa 2002. 

- Copy it. Steal it. Use it. I don't care. But I'd try to learn a little on your path. 

- Have questions? Cool, don't ask me. ChatGPT your own life. Cheers. 

## What I might do

- I have free OpenAI credits. Look up microsoft for founders if you haven't (you are welcome). Build out 5000 AI programmatic translated blog posts on lifting and burn those credits.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
