    <h1>About One Rep Max Calculator</h1>
    
    <h2>What is One Rep Max (1RM)?</h2>
    <p>
      One Rep Max (1RM) is the maximum amount of weight that can be lifted for a single repetition 
      for a given exercise. It's a crucial metric for strength training and programming, helping 
      athletes and fitness enthusiasts track their progress and set appropriate training loads.
    </p>

    <h2>How Our Calculators Work</h2>
    <p>
      We use five different scientifically-validated formulas to estimate your 1RM:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Epley Formula:</strong> Most commonly used, provides reliable estimates across 
        different rep ranges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Brzycki Formula:</strong> Particularly accurate for repetitions between 1-10.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>McGlothin Formula:</strong> Offers a different approach that some find more 
        accurate for their lifting style.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lombardi Formula:</strong> Uses an exponential calculation that some powerlifters 
        prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>O'Conner Formula:</strong> A simpler calculation that still provides reliable 
        estimates.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Safety Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always warm up properly before attempting heavy lifts</li>
      <li>Use proper form and technique</li>
      <li>Have a spotter when attempting near-maximal lifts</li>
      <li>Progress gradually to prevent injury</li>
      <li>Listen to your body and rest when needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using the Results</h2>
    <p>
      The calculated 1RM is an estimate and should be used as a guide. When programming your 
      training, use these numbers to calculate appropriate working weights for different rep ranges 
      and intensities.
